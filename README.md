# CodingAssignments
Herein lies a few console applications developed during a software development module at university as assignments.
The objective of these applications was to showcase a working knowledge of coding constructs within C++ as the course progressed, such as arrays, classes, lists, queues, templates, sorting algorithms & more.
Various arbitrary constraints were placed on the methods used to ensure these skills would be used (such as that within 2.1.1). Item 1.2 was open ended ("...write an application that does something.") - initially this was to be a chess game, but the realisation of time constraints close to the deadline forced this to be abandoned & a different, less fun, application to be spawned.
